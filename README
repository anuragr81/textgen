Defining with two atoms is difficult. What I had been thinking was to define basic operations. But adding more basic operations would add more complexity to definitions. Defining more atoms is far more manageable than definite more operations.
I think mathematical operations and logical operations are sufficient. Mathematics shows that addition alone is sufficient. and logic shows that and + not is sufficient for all logic. Still +,-,/,* and AND,OR,NOT are defined for convenience.
